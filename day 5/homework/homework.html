<h1>Speedrunning</h1>
<p>Speedrunning is the act of playing a video game, or section of a video game, with the goal of 
    completing it as fast as possible. Speedrunning often involves following planned routes, which 
    may incorporate sequence breaking and exploit glitches that allow sections to be skipped or 
    completed more quickly than intended. Tool-assisted speedrunning (TAS) is a subcategory of 
    speedrunning that uses emulation software or additional tools to create a precisely controlled 
    sequence of inputs.

    Many online communities revolve around speedrunning specific games; community leaderboard rankings 
    for individual games form the primary competitive metric for speedrunning. Racing between two or
    more speedrunners is also a popular form of competition. Videos and livestreams of speedruns 
    are shared via the internet on media sites such as YouTube and Twitch. Speedruns are sometimes
    showcased at marathon events, which are gaming conventions that feature multiple people 
    performing speedruns in a variety of games.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early examples</h3>
<p>Speedrunning has been a part of video games since the early days of the medium, similar to the 
    chasing of high scores, though it did not achieve broad interest until 1993. Some groundwork for 
    what would become modern speedrunning was established by id Software during the development for 
    Wolfenstein 3D (1992), although prior games such as Metroid (1986) and Prince of Persia (1989) 
    encouraged speedrunning by noting a player's time upon meeting certain metrics, including 
    completion of the game. Wolfenstein 3D recorded a "par time" statistic which was based on 
    John Romero's personal records for each level. Romero's best level times were also printed 
    in the official hint book, which was available via the same mail-order system used to 
    distribute the game at the time. His intention was that players would attempt to beat his 
    times.</p>
<h3>Doom and Quake demos, early Internet communities</h3>
<p>The development of a strong speedrunning community is considered to have originated with 
    the 1993 computer game Doom.[2][3][4] The game retained the "par time" mechanic from 
    Wolfenstein and included a feature that allowed players to record and play back gameplay
    using files called demos (also known as game replays). Demos were lightweight files 
    that could be shared more easily than video files on Internet bulletin board systems at
    the time.[5] Internally,[6] in January 1994, University of Waterloo student Christina 
    Norman created a File Transfer Protocol server dedicated to compiling demos, named the
    LMP Hall of Fame (after the .lmp file extension used by Doom demos). The LMP Hall of 
    Fame inspired the creation of the Doom Honorific Titles by Frank Stajano, a catalogue
    of titles that a player could obtain by beating certain challenges in the game.[5][3] 
    The Doom speedrunning community emerged in November 1994, when Simon Widlake created 
    COMPET-N, a website hosting leaderboards dedicated to ranking completion times of 
    Doom's single-player levels.
    <br> In 1996, id Software released Quake as a successor to the Doom series. Like 
    its predecessor, Quake had a demo-recording feature and drew attention from speedrunners.
    [5][7] In April 1997, Nolan "Radix" Pflug created Nightmare Speed Demos (NSD), a website 
    for tracking Quake speedruns.[5] In June 1997, Pflug released a full-game speedrun demo of 
    Quake called Quake Done Quick, which introduced speedrunning to a broader audience.[5][3] 
    Quake speedruns were notable for their breadth of movement techniques, including "bunny 
    hopping," a method of gaining speed also present in future shooting games like Counter-Strike 
    and Team Fortress.[5][3] In April 1998, NSD merged with another demo-hosting website to 
    create Speed Demos Archive.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>Gameplay strategies</h3>
<p>Routing is a fundamental process in speedrunning.[12][13] Routing is the act of developing an 
    optimal sequence of actions and stages in a video game. A route may involve skipping one or 
    more important items or sections. Skipping a part of a video game that is normally required 
    for progression is referred to as sequence breaking,[13] a term first used in reference to the 
    2002 action-adventure game Metroid Prime.[5] Video game glitches may be used to achieve 
    sequence breaks,[13] or may be used for other purposes such as skipping cutscenes and increasing
    the player's speed or damage output.[5][14] Some people, called glitch-hunters, choose to focus
    on finding glitches that will be useful to speedrunners.[15] In some games, arbitrary code 
    execution exploits may be possible, allowing players to write their own code into the game's 
    memory. Several speedruns use a "credits warp", a category of glitch that causes the game's 
    credits sequence to play, which may require arbitrary code execution.[16][17][18] The use of
    glitches and sequence breaks in speedruns was historically not allowed, per the rules of 
    Twin Galaxies' early leaderboards. When speedrunning moved away from Twin Galaxies towards
    independent online leaderboards, their use became increasingly common.</p>
<h3>Categorization and ranking</h3>
<p>Speedruns are divided into various categories that impose additional limitations on a runner. 
    It is common for category restrictions to require a certain amount of content to be completed
    in the game.[5] Each video game may have its own speedrun categories, but some categories are
    popular irrespective of game.[19] The most common are:

<br>Any%, which involves getting to the end as fast as possible with no qualifier,[5][26]
<br>100%, which requires full completion of a game. This may entail obtaining all items or may use some other metric.[5][26]
<br>Low%, the opposite of 100%, which requires the player to beat the game while completing the minimum amount possible.[5][26]
<br>Glitchless, which restricts the player from performing any glitches during the speedrun.[13][19]
<br>No Major Glitches, Which consist of beating the game as fast as possible while not using any "game breaking" glitches.
Speedrunners compete in these categories by ranking times on online leaderboards.[5] According to 
Wired, the definitive website for speedrun leaderboards is Speedrun.com. As of July 2021, the site 
hosts leaderboards for over 20,000 video games.[27] Runners usually record footage of their 
speedruns for accurate timing and verification, and may include a timer in their videos. 
They often use timers that keep track of splitsâ€”the time between the start of the run and 
the completion of some section or objective.[5] Verification is usually done by leaderboard
moderators who review submissions and determine the validity of individual speedruns.</p>
<h2>Cheating</h2>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<h4>Splicing</h4>
<p>Splicing is by far the most popular cheating method in speedrunning.[40][41] Here, a 
    speedrun is not recorded continuously, as is usually the case, but instead composed of various
    video snippets recorded at different times, sometimes with gameplay stolen from TAS 
    composers or legitimate players. <br> In a typical case, splicing allows difficult 
    segments to be repeated to perfection and edited together afterwards into one seemingly 
    continuous effort, which can sometimes dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to 
    grind out a comparable score.[41] However, a spliced run is not considered cheating if it
    is announced to be a multi-segment run upon submission; for example, this community-made 
    multi-segment compilation for Super Mario Bros.</p>
<h4>TASbotting</h4>
<p>When 'TASbotting', the player records their controller inputs as a tool-assisted run in an 
    external device in order to then have this device reproduce the inputs on a real console.
    [41] As with splicing, the inputs of individual segments can be combined and, as is usual 
    for tool-assisted runs, inputs can be made frame by frame. As long as these inputs are 
    authentic and seem realistic for a human being, such manipulations are much more difficult 
    to detect in the resulting video product than splicing.[41] If, on the other hand, a TAS is 
    not outputted on the original hardware but, as usual, on emulators, it can sometimes be 
    alleged from the resulting video that such auxiliary programs were used; additionally, some 
    emulators never perfectly imitate the desired hardware, which can cause synchronization 
    issues when replayed on a console.</p>
<h4>Modifying the timer or playback speed</h4>
<p>Modifying game timers, especially on computer games, is another common method to improve one's 
    recorded times. However, this is a very noticeable manipulation, especially in highly 
    competitive areas, since the speedruns in the upper area of leaderboards are repeatedly 
    analyzed by other players in order to check their legitimacy and playback reproducibility, 
    including a temporal check known as "retiming". This often reveals discrepancies between 
    one's recording time and a speedrun in the leaderboards.[41] <br>
Another method, a variation of splicing, includes speeding up cutscenes or compressing transitional 
black space. Again, such methods are likely to be detected by a speedrun moderator, although some 
games, especially where PC speed can have an effect, may actually vary depending on hardware. <br>
Finally, another common cheating method is to play the game using frame-by-frame advancement or in 
slow motion, which is similar to normal tool-assisted speedrunning but without the ability to redo 
inputs. Playing in slow motion is often effective for games that require very precise movements.</p>
<h4>Modifying in-game files</h4>
<p>While it is often possible to use traditional cheats such as a GameShark to increase character 
    speed, strength, health, etc., such cheats are generally quite easy for an experienced 
    moderator to detect, even when applied subtly. However, the modification of internal files 
    to improve RNG can often be much more difficult to detect. <br>
One of the most infamous examples of file modification was several cheated runs by the speedrunner
Dream in 2020, whose luck was considered so extreme in a series of Minecraft speedruns that they 
were considered exceedingly unlikely to have been done without cheating (with an approximately 
1 in 20 sextillion chance of occurring, as estimated by Matt Parker from Numberphile) by both the 
moderators at Speedrun.com and various YouTubers, such as Karl Jobst and Matt Parker, whose videos 
on Dream gained a combined 5.7 million and 6.5 million views, respectively, as of January 2024.[a] 
Dream later admitted to the runs being cheated about five months after his runs were rejected, 
although he claimed he did not know he was using a modified version of the game.[49][50][51] Nearly 
two years later, the player who helped uncover Dream's cheated runs, MinecrAvenger, was also found 
to be using similar luck manipulation in late 2022.</p>
<h3>Cheat detection</h3>
<p>In order to prevent most of these methods, some games require a video of the hands on the 
    controller or keyboard ("handcam"), in addition to the screen recording, so that game-specific 
    moderators in charge of authenticating a submission can ensure that the inputs are really 
    done in the specified combination and by a human.[60] Other methods include forensic audio 
    analysis, which is a common method for detecting telltale signs of video splicing; this is 
    why runs without high-quality audio streams are often rejected on speedrun boards.
    Additional detection methods are the use of mathematics (as in the aforementioned Dream case) or 
    human moderation of suspicious inputs (in games which record them such as Doom and TrackMania). 
    Cheat detection software created for TrackMania was used to analyze over 400,000 replays and 
    isolate a handful of cheaters, leading to hundreds of world records being determined to have 
    been cheated using slowdown tools. This included those of Burim "riolu" Fejza, who was signed 
    to the eSports team Nordavind (now known as 00 Nation) before being dropped following the 
    scandal.</p>
